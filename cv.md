### Summary
For a long time, I worked as a developer at a mining company. I mostly worked with databases and developed desktop applications and did not pay attention to what was going on in the IT world. One day I found out that the world was changing and IT is not the same when I graduated. I decided to make up for lost time and took up front-end development.
